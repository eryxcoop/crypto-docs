# Security
This is a place where security issues should be explained. Example:

- Discrete Log attacks: [Baby-step giant-step](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step) for groups of prime order, [Pohlig-Hellman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pohlig%E2%80%93Hellman_algorithm) for groups whose order is a smooth integer,  SSSA attack for curves whose group order is the same as the field order, [MOV attack](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1871/how-does-the-mov-attack-work) to reduce discrete log in elliptic curves to discrte log in $\mathbb{F}_p$ by using pairings, [Singular curve](https://fdtc.deib.polimi.it/FDTC15/shared/FDTC-2015-session_4_1.pdf) reduce a curve to a simpler curve and solve there the discrete log problem.
